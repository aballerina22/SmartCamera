Hi, we are Keely and Amy, senior Electrical Engineering students at LMU. This is a repository for the code we will be using for our senior capstone project.  Language: MATLAB


A record of our progress throughout the year is at https://srprojectanonymoussecurity.wordpress.com/


We are using the Image Acquisition Toolbox Support Package for Kinect For Windows Sensor
hardware support package in MATLAB with the Kinect V1. 
Documentation for this package can be found at the following link:
